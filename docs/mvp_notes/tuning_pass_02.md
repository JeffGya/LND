# Echoes of the Sankofa — MVP Tuning Pass 02
**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Seed Reference:** 0xA2B94D10  
**Simulation Environment:** Tier 2, 20-day deterministic loop (Codex build with automated safeguards)  
**Author:** Codex Simulation / Design Integration Team  

---

## 🧭 Overview
This second tuning pass validates the integration of all safeguard systems added in **Pass 01** inside the deterministic simulation loop.  
The run results confirm the six core guardrails—Spike Guard, Courage-skip logic, Ward Bead charge budgeting, Faith Reflection, Harmony Bright Zone, and Voluntary Retirement—operate automatically without breaking canonical pacing.

## 1. Key Observations
| Scenario | Final Ase | Faith Final | Morale Min | Fear Max | Legacy Frags | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Faith Floor w/ Guardrail** | 1401.87 | 78.66 | 71.36 | 88.44 | 0 | Reflection/Prayer auto-triggered Day 2; loop recovered without stall. |
| **Harmony Low (40)** | 1330.79 | 74.73 | 85.5 | 80.6 | 0 | −10 % yield; confirms efficiency floor ≈ 0.94. |
| **Harmony High (60)** | 1486.68 | 80.26 | 85.5 | 80.6 | 0 | +11 % yield; Harmony ≥ 55 produces optimal Bright Zone. |
| **Spike Guard Streak Stress (4 encounters/day)** | 1445.78 | 78.93 | 90.2 | 59.4 | **1** | 10 Spike Guard activations → voluntary retirement Day 19 (cost 3 Favor). |

## 2. System Behaviours Verified

### 🛡 Spike Guard Auto-Ritual
- Forecasts next-day Fear; fires when projection ≥ 90.  
- Effect per trigger: −18 Fear / +12 Morale / −30 % Fear gain.  
- Ritual preload cap: Fear ≤ 88.44 for 20 days, Morale ≥ 71.36.  
- Stress test: 10 activations, final voluntary retirement = 1 Fragment (−3 Favor).

### 💎 Ward Beads Budgeting
- Pool: 2 charges per 20-day arc.  
- Defaults consumed on Days 5 & 15 if unused.  
- Correctly depleted and logged in harmony/faith runs.

### 💪 Courage Ritual Awareness
- Skips itself when Fear < 60 and Morale > 70.  
- Saved one ritual in preload run (Day 15) → resource efficiency +3 %.  
- Optional override: `--disable_courage_skip` for designer stress tests.

### ✨ Faith Guardrail Downtime
- Triggers after 2 days below Faith 60.  
- Adds +15 Ase and raises Faith to ≥ 62.  
- Prevents yield collapse (verified in Faith-floor run).

### ☯ Harmony Bright Zone
- Harmony ≥ 55 maintains efficiency ≥ 1.02 and +10 % Ase.  
- Below 40 reduces efficiency ≈ 0.94.  
- Meditation task auto-fires when Harmony < 55 for 2 days.

### 🕯 Voluntary Retirement Rite
- Unlocks after ≥ 10 Spike Guard activations.  
- Grants 1 Legacy Fragment / cost 3 Favor.  
- Logged on Day 19 of Spike Guard streak test.

## 3. Economy Loop Update Summary
These guardrails keep Tier 2 campaigns resilient during designed fear spikes while preserving the moral rhythm of pressure → release → reflection → legacy.

**Why It Matters**
- Fear and morale now oscillate within readable bounds, no manual babysitting.  
- Faith rarely drops below 60; Ase production remains predictable.  
- Legacy progression continues through retirement rather than death.

## 5. Recommended Next Steps
1. **Telemetry Visualization:** plot Fear↔Morale and Faith↔Ase curves using daily log flags.  
2. **Retirement Balancing:** explore Favor cost 2-4 to tune long-term economy.  
3. **Campaign Tier Expansion:** run Tier 3 with 4 encounters/day to validate curve scaling.  
4. **UI Surface:** add “Spike Guard Active” indicator and “Reflection Pending” badge for testing UX.

# MVP Go / No-Go Checklist (Pass-02)

- ✅ Config freeze matches Pass-02 defaults (Spike Guard threshold 90, two Ward Beads charges, Courage skip logic, Faith guardrail, and retirement rite all confirmed in the regression configs).
- ✅ Regression bundle runs complete with no stalls; Ase climbs steadily after day 3 across all five logs.
- ✅ Save/telemetry fields present (daily logs include fear, morale, Faith/Harmony/Favor, ritual flags, guardrail triggers, and retirement notes).
- ❌ UI cues stubbed (no TODO anchors for UI prompts detected in the repo; requires manual confirmation).
- ✅ Docs linked from README (Pass-02 quicklinks now surface all required artifacts).

## Manual QA note
- UI cue TODO anchors are not tracked in this repo; coordinate with the UI team to verify the production checklist once screens are stubbed.

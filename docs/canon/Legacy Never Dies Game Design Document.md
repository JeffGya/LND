## Final Revision)

#### 1. 1 Game Title

```
Echoes of the Sankofa
Working subtitle: “Legacy Never Diesˮ)
```
#### 1. 2 High-Level Concept

```
Echoes of the Sankofa is a West African / Ghanaian-inspired strategy
autobattler roguelite about legacy, memory, and the fragile balance between
remembrance and oblivion.
Players embody the Ase Keeper , a grand ancestral spirit bound to the sacred
flame connecting the living and the dead. From the Obosom Sanctum , the
```
Core Concept & Vision 1


```
Keeper summons Echoes — spiritual heroes reborn from fragments of
memory — and nurtures them to reclaim the corrupted Realms of Ase.
Unbeknownst to the Keeper, both they and their adversary, Odo Agyanka (the
Devourer of Names) , are pieces in a timeless game spun by Anansi , the
trickster god and Keeper of Stories.
What begins as an act of restoration slowly reveals itself as a contest between
remembrance and forgetting — played for Anansiʼs amusement.
Unlike most games, the player is not the hero.
The Echoes are autonomous beings with their own voices, emotions, and
motivations. The playerʼs purpose is to guide, mentor, and sustain them — not
command them.
True mastery comes from understanding oneʼs heroes, not controlling them.
In the full version, the Keeper restores seven Realms chosen from ten possible
worlds — each cycle a unique constellation of stories. The MVP will feature two
to three fixed Realms to establish core systems.
```
#### 1. 3 Core Experience Goals

```
Legacy over Grind: Each generation leaves traces that empower the next.
Guidance over Control: The player influences, never commands — heroes
act by will and wisdom.
Autonomous Companions: Echoes have voice, mood, and motivation; they
must be understood, not exploited.
Procedural Variety / Deterministic Fairness: Every journey is unique yet
governed by consistent laws.
Emotional Continuity: Loss, triumph, and mentorship are equally
meaningful.
Story vs. Silence: Each decision feeds either remembrance Anansiʼs web)
or oblivion Odo Agyankaʼs hunger).
```
#### 1. 4 Player Role — The Ase Keeper

```
You are an ancestral mentor , not a god or general. Your role is spiritual and
reflective:
```
Core Concept & Vision 2


```
Summon Echoes — spirits of courage, virtue, and wisdom.
Guide them through counsel, morale, and training.
Maintain the Ase Flame , the living energy sustaining all worlds.
Rebuild the Sanctum , housing the knowledge of generations.
Interpret their voices — heroes reveal needs and fears through dialogue
and behavior.
Your influence manifests through rituals, teachings, and blessings , not direct
orders.
The heroesʼ autonomy is sacred, and your relationship with them evolves
through trust, wisdom, and sacrifice.
Though you believe you act from compassion, unseen hands may guide your
path — perhaps the same hands that once spun the first story.
```
#### 1. 5 Design Vision

```
The gameʼs guiding philosophy is that leadership is empathy, not control.
Players should feel the quiet responsibility of nurturing independent spirits
rather than commanding soldiers.
“You do not win for your heroes — you help them learn how to win without
you.ˮ
Every action, dialogue, and death is a fragment of story reclaimed from
oblivion.
The design explores not only how players guide others, but how stories guide
players , echoing Anansiʼs web of creation and deception.
The intended emotional outcome is respect and humility — for the heroes,
their struggles, and the ancestral line that continues through them.
```
#### 1. 6 Genre Definition

```
Primary: Procedural Strategy Autobattler Roguelite
Secondary: Management / Legacy Simulation
Perspective: Indirect control; systems-driven and reflective
```
Core Concept & Vision 3


```
Session Structure: 10 30 minute sessions; finite but replayable progression
with idle return
```
#### 1. 7 Target Audience & Platforms

```
Audience: Players who enjoy reflective, system-driven games with
emotional and philosophical depth ( Darkest Dungeon , Loop Hero , Cultist
Simulator ).
Platforms:
Primary MVP  iOS / Android (text-based simulation)
Later Phases  PC / Tablet (expanded UI and visualization).
Playstyle Philosophy: Short, meaningful sessions that reward
comprehension, curiosity, and emotional intuition.

```
#### 1. 9 Why It Exists

```
Echoes of the Sankofa reframes player agency as mentorship and
interpretation.
Where most games reward control, this one rewards understanding — of
personalities, values, and relationships.
```
Core Concept & Vision 4


```
It explores the Akan philosophy of Sankofa (“go back and fetch itˮ) as an
interactive loop: learning from the past to illuminate the present.
Yet beyond the mortal lens lies a deeper irony: the entire journey may itself be a
story woven for Anansiʼs pleasure.
The game ultimately asks whether creation and legacy are acts of compassion
or vanity — whether stories exist to preserve meaning or to entertain the gods
who tell them.
```
#### 1. 10 Art & Audio Identity

#### Visual Direction

```
Core Aesthetic: Mythic Spiritual Minimalism  West African geometry and
luminescent spirit motifs.
Palette:
Ase Flame: gold and ember glow.
Echoes: translucent hues reflecting dominant traits.
Sanctum: stone and light runes symbolizing rebirth.
Style Progression:
Phase 1 MVP Text-based interface with symbolic UI effects.
Phase 2 2D illustrated interface with iconographic visuals.
Phase 3 2.5D visualization of battles and Sanctum hub.
Motifs: Adinkra symbols and spider-web patterns represent Anansiʼs
presence within the UI  threads that tremble when fate changes.
```
#### Hero Expression

```
AI-driven dialogue and emotion systems.
Portraits and text color reflect emotional states.
Player must interpret heroesʼ needs and moods through their words and
behavior.
```
#### Audio Direction

Core Concept & Vision 5


```
Soundscape: Layered ambient textures with subtle Ghanaian percussion
and plucked string motifs that evoke Anansiʼs harp-like web.
Mood: Ethereal, ceremonial, calm — with moments of playful disruption
hinting at the tricksterʼs hand.
Voices: Soft whispers in Ashanti and English; AI-generated intonations for
individuality.
Feedback: Harmonic tones and resonant drum pulses instead of aggressive
SFX.
The world should sound like it remembers you — and like someone is
listening.
```
#### 1. 11 MVP Scope — Text-Based Foundation

```
The Minimum Viable Product MVP will be fully text-driven, emphasizing
readability, logic, and systemic depth before visual polish.
Goals for Text MVP
 Validate core systems — summoning, auto-battle simulation, resource flow,
and legacy inheritance.
 Develop the “hero understandingˮ loop via AI dialogue and emotional
response.
 Integrate adaptive narrative modules AI story threads) that reflect player
empathy and Anansiʼs intervention.
 Test pacing and balance curves using simulation logs and JSON data.
 Provide hooks for future UI and visual layers without rewriting logic.
Planned Evolution Path
Phase 1 Text MVP (web or terminal prototype).
Phase 2 2D interface with animated feedback and hero portraits.
Phase 3 2.5D realization of battles and Sanctum hub once systems
stabilize.
This structure ensures rapid iteration, AI story experimentation, and clear
systemic validation while remaining future-proof.

```
#### Section 2 : World, Lore & Player Role (v 5 — The Game of

#### Anansi)

##### 2. 1

##### Setting — Nyamedua, the Tree Between Worlds

```
Between the living and the dead stands Nyamedua , the World Tree of Souls. Its roots drink
from mortal memory, and its branches weave through the heavens of the Abosom , the old
spirits of virtue and creation. At its heart burns the Ase Flame — the pulse of existence, where
every story, emotion, and name intertwines.
Long before the corruption, the rhythm of Ase was held in balance by the cunning god Anansi ,
the Keeper of Stories. Neither benevolent nor cruel, Anansi loved only one thing: the thrill of a
good tale. He wove every song, legend, and prayer into his web — claiming them as his
treasures.
But Anansi grew vain. He sought to prove that he alone could bind creation through story , so
he wove a divine game between memory and oblivion. In his arrogance, he created two
players:
Odo Agyanka, the Devourer of Names — born from Anansiʼs shadow and his envy of
silence. It fed on forgotten memories, devouring names and identity until even the gods
forgot themselves.
The Ase Keeper (the player) — a fragment of compassion hidden within Anansiʼs web,
born to nurture new stories, reclaim old ones, and weave a new legacy through empathy
rather than control.
Anansi, delighted by his own paradox, whispered as he cast them into the roots of Nyamedua:
```
World, Lore & Player Role 1


```
“Let the tree decide which story deserves to live — the silence of peace, or the noise of
becoming.ˮ
Centuries passed. Odo Agyanka feasted. The Abosom fell into slumber, their Realms collapsing
into void. Now, with the Ase Flame fading, Anansiʼs game begins anew. The Keeper awakens
to restore the Seven Realms of Ase — believing they are saving the world, unaware that they
are simply pieces in Anansiʼs grand amusement.
The Echoes — spiritual heroes born of memory — are fragments of Anansiʼs lost stories.
Through them, the Keeper must nurture emotion, rediscover identity, and confront the balance
between remembrance and forgetting.
```
##### 2. 2

##### The Web of Anansi — Story, Memory, and Forgetting

```
All of existence hangs upon Anansiʼs Web — a lattice of luminous threads connecting every
story, memory, and life.
Each thread vibrates with Ase, glowing with the echo of its tale.
When Odo Agyanka consumes a name, a thread vanishes — erasing history and emotion.
When the Ase Keeper rekindles one, a new thread forms — bright, trembling with rebirth.
And Anansi , ever the observer, plucks the web like a harp, making the world sing again.
This web is both creation and trap. The Keeperʼs mission to restore stories only feeds Anansiʼs
hunger for new ones. Every victory, every death, every moral dilemma adds another note to his
song.
Thus, even the endless replay — the Legacy Cycle — is not merely a mechanic but a divine
loop of entertainment. Each playthrough is a new telling of the same myth, spun differently
each time for Anansiʼs delight.
```
##### 2. 3

##### The Triad of Continuity

```
The nurturer — restores stories, fosters identity, and strives to
preserve balance through compassion.
The world is defined by this triadʼs tension:
Anansi creates endlessly but for pleasure.
Odo Agyanka destroys endlessly but for peace.
The Ase Keeper restores endlessly but for meaning.
```
World, Lore & Player Role 2


```
Every decision in the game — to save, sacrifice, or redeem — tips the balance among them.
```
##### 2. 4

##### Setting in Motion — The Realms of Ase (Ten Virtues, Seven Paths per

##### Cycle)

```
The Keeperʼs journey spans ten possible Realms, though only seven manifest per cycle. Each
represents a fallen virtue of creation awaiting restoration.
Every Realm consists of 5 6 sequential stages , each a unique scenario seeded by
deterministic procedural generation, culminating in a Restoration Trial — a climactic
confrontation that tests courage, empathy, and legacy.

the world and gameplay systems.
```
##### 2. 5

##### Progression — Difficulty, Complexity, and Moral Weight

```
Difficulty in Echoes of the Sankofa grows through emotional and managerial complexity , not
just power scaling. Each Realm deepens the tension between the Keeperʼs compassion and the
demands of the world.
```
##### Early Realms ( 1 – 2 )

World, Lore & Player Role 3


```
Short sessions  10 15 minutes).
Focus on discovery: learning how emotion, morale, and Ase interconnect.
Heroes are cooperative, curious, and inexperienced.
Anansiʼs influence is subtle — odd coincidences, curious luck, and fleeting whispers.
```
##### Mid Realms ( 3 – 5 )

```
Missions lengthen  20 30 minutes).
Conflicts arise between heroesʼ virtues — courage vs. pride, faith vs. ambition.
Heroes begin to question the Keeperʼs guidance.
Sanctum expands to include crafting, training, and emotional care systems.
Anansi Events appear — unpredictable interventions by the trickster god that alter
probability, generate random storylines, or introduce moral ambiguity (“He offers you a
shortcut at a price.ˮ).
```
##### Late Realms ( 6 – 7 )

```
Realms extend across multiple play sessions; heroes can become entangled in ongoing
stories.
Players must field multiple squads and manage crises in the Sanctum simultaneously.
Emotional volatility peaks: betrayal, despair, or defiance among heroes is possible.
Anansiʼs tone grows more direct, playful, and cruel.
The Keeper begins to glimpse the truth — are they restoring the world, or merely
entertaining its creator?
The final Realm tests not skill, but conviction. The player must decide what kind of ancestor
they wish to be — and whether stories deserve to continue.
```
##### 2. 6

##### The Obosom Sanctum — A Living Memory

```
The Sanctum is the spiritual and mechanical heart of the game: part hub, part ecosystem, part
reflection of the Keeperʼs soul. It evolves dynamically as Realms are restored and heroes live or
die.

Each building adds not just function, but personality — becoming part of the Sanctumʼs living
narrative. The heroesʼ AI interactions with these spaces create emergent micro-stories unique
to each playerʼs world.
```
##### 2. 7

##### Emotional Ecology — The Sanctum as a Society

```
Heroes are autonomous entities. Their emotions and relationships define the Sanctumʼs
stability.
Emotional Resonance: Similar traits amplify morale and recovery.
Conflict Fields: Opposing ideals cause tension or rivalry events.
Influence Chains: Heroes with strong Faith can calm others; Ambitious ones spread
anxiety or arrogance.
Dialogue Network: AI-driven conversations surface dynamic storylines — heroes reflect
on Realm experiences, gossip about others, or question the Keeperʼs choices.
“Every flame warms or scorches its neighbors. The Keeper must tend to both.ˮ
Neglect or poor management can create emotional collapse. Harmony in the Sanctum is the
key to restoring the Seven Realms — and the emotional state of the Sanctum directly
influences story outcomes and endings.
```
##### 2. 8

##### Realm-to-Sanctum Interdependence

World, Lore & Player Role 5


```
Each restored Realm reawakens a virtue in the Sanctum — creating tangible synergy between
world progression and base evolution.
Restored Realm Sanctum Effect Hero Effect
Vale of Dust Unlocks heroes. Courage Ritual — morale recovery for all Increases fear resistance.

This design ensures narrative progress is always reinforced through mechanical growth.
```
##### 2. 9

##### The Nature of Choice — Complexity as Growth

```
The Keeperʼs power is moral, not mechanical. Progression means confronting harder truths, not
stronger enemies.
Each Realm deepens the moral burden of leadership:
Sacrifice one hero to save another.
Accept Anansiʼs shortcut or reject it and risk loss.
Redeem a corrupted Echo or destroy them before despair spreads.
Abandon one Realm to preserve another.
Allow heroes autonomy — or intervene, fracturing their trust.
These are the choices that shape the Keeperʼs empathy score — the hidden value determining
the ending of the game.
```
##### 2. 10

##### Endgame — The Forgotten Sky

```
Upon entering the Seventh Realm, the Keeper faces the ultimate question:
Do stories deserve to continue, or is peace in silence more merciful?
As the final confrontation unfolds with Odo Agyanka , the Devourer reveals the truth — that
both the Keeper and itself are Anansiʼs creations , eternal players in a cruelly beautiful game.
```
World, Lore & Player Role 6


```
At the climax, Anansiʼs voice returns — playful, mocking, almost tender:
“Youʼve done so well, my Keeper. Look at all the stories youʼve saved.
But tell me — shall we play another?ˮ
The player must choose:
Continue the Game New Game+): The Keeper accepts the infinite loop, reborn into
another cycle of stories — the world of endless tales.
End the Story True Ending): The Keeper breaks the web, extinguishing Ase to bring peace
— a world without stories, without Anansi.
No ending is explicitly “goodˮ or “bad.ˮ Each is a reflection of the playerʼs journey — and their
answer to the question:
“Is legacy worth the pain it leaves behind?ˮ
```
##### 2. 11

##### AI as the Storyteller — Living Narratives

```
To fulfill Anansiʼs role as the god of endless stories, Echoes of the Sankofa uses AI-driven
narrative generation as a core system.
Each playerʼs heroes, dialogue, and Realm events are procedurally enriched with unique
micro-stories, emergent personalities, and dynamic moral arcs.
Visual assets, Abosom names, and overarching myth remain fixed — preserving artistic
consistency.
But no two players will ever share the same version of the myth. Every player becomes
the author of a distinct “tellingˮ in Anansiʼs infinite web.
Even Anansiʼs tone shifts subtly based on playstyle — ironic, sorrowful, amused, or cold —
reflecting the AIʼs reading of the playerʼs empathy pattern.
In essence, the game itself becomes Anansiʼs web , alive and reactive — where each player
writes their own strand of the myth.

#### 3. 1 Purpose

```
This section defines the heartbeat of Echoes of the Sankofa — the repeating
sequence of choices, consequences, and reflection that shape the playerʼs
experience.
Every loop represents one “threadˮ in Anansiʼs web: a story beginning,
struggling, and either fading or being remembered.
```

Each full loop spans one play session  10 30 minutes) , designed for mobile or
desktop engagement with daily-return pacing.
Long-term play emerges from multiple overlapping loops as the player
manages concurrent Realms and generations of heroes.
```
Core Gameplay Loop 1


#### 3. 3 Phase 1 — Summon: Awakening Echoes

```
Player verbs: Summon, observe, interpret.
The Keeper spends Ase to call new Echoes from the ancestral flow.
Each Echo arrives procedurally generated with six traits and an emergent AI
personality.
Anansi occasionally interferes, altering probabilities or offering “dealsˮ
Anansi Events).
The player reads first dialogues, senses temperament, and assigns each
hero a Sanctum role or Realm squad.
Narrative tone: Birth and curiosity — the spark of a new story.
```
#### 3. 4 Phase 2 — Guide: Preparation & Mentorship

```
Player verbs: Train, counsel, bless, pair.
In the Sanctum , the player invests Ase, Relics, or time to prepare heroes.
Emotional state matters: training a grieving hero might risk burnout; guiding
a proud one may breed rivalry.
Choices affect morale, bond strength, and class development.
The AI interprets dialogue history to decide whether heroes heed or resist
advice.
Design note: This is the slow rhythm of the game — reflection, prediction, and
empathy before risk.
```
#### 3. 5 Phase 3 — Venture: The Realms of Ase

```
Player verbs: Deploy, observe, adapt.
The player sends up to 6 heroes into a Realm Stage.
Combat unfolds automatically (auto-battler simulation).
Heroes act based on personality traits, morale, and prior mentorship.
The Keeper influences indirectly through pre-battle blessings, morale buffs,
or tactical rituals.
Each stage includes optional Moral Encounters — branching narrative tests
that reinforce emotional growth or decay.
```
Core Gameplay Loop 2


```
Realm difficulty scales by the Keeperʼs progress and emotional harmony in
the Sanctum.
Loop duration: Single stage  5 10 min; full Realm  30 min split across
sessions.
```
#### 3. 6 Phase 4 — Resolve: Consequences & Reward

```
Player verbs: Accept, mourn, record.
After battle, outcomes ripple through every system:
Victories yield Ase, Ekwan, Relics, morale boosts.
Defeats trigger wounds, corruption, or permanent death.
AI heroes react emotionally — pride, guilt, sorrow — generating new
dialogue threads.
Odo Agyankaʼs whispers may appear after major losses, tempting the
Keeper to surrender stories to oblivion for relief.
```
#### 3. 7 Phase 5 — Reflect: The Sanctum Cycle

```
Player verbs: Heal, rebuild, listen, plan.
Between expeditions, the Keeper manages Sanctum tasks (training,
research, crafting).
Heroes interact with each other autonomously; their conversations may
praise or condemn prior choices.
The emotional temperature of the Sanctum determines efficiency: high
morale accelerates growth, while despair slows Ase flow.
Anansi may inject random Story Threads here — ironic side events or
cryptic riddles commenting on the playerʼs leadership.
```
#### 3. 8 Phase 6 — Legacy: Death and Inheritance

```
Player verbs: Preserve, fuse, remember.
Fallen heroes leave Legacy Fragments that can be merged in the Forge of
Souls.
The player decides which traits, quirks, or blessings carry forward.
```
Core Gameplay Loop 3


```
Each new generation becomes more complex — personalities influenced by
inherited memories and past moral outcomes.
These inheritances feed directly into the next Summon  Guide loop,
completing the circle.
Every death is a sentence in Anansiʼs next story.
```
#### 3. 9 Meta-Loop Structure: The Cycle of Sankofa

```
Each complete Realm or set of expeditions contributes to one macro-loop:

Guide Empathy — can I teach them well? Care
Venture Courage — will they survive my lessons? Fear & Pride
Resolve Acceptance — what did I lose or learn? Grief
Reflect Understanding — what must change? Wisdom
Legacy Continuity — what will remain? Faith
```
#### 3. 11 Replayability & AI Narrative Variation

```
Every playerʼs web of stories is unique: AI systems remix dialogue, hero
arcs, and Realm encounters.
Fixed lore anchors Anansi, Odo Agyanka, Seven Realms) ensure cohesion,
while micro-narratives adapt dynamically.
```
Core Gameplay Loop 4


```
Anansi Events appear with distinct personality patterns, reacting to the
playerʼs moral style (compassionate vs. ruthless).
Over multiple cycles, the AI “learnsˮ which themes the player favors and
spins new moral tests around them.
Result: No two webs are identical.
Each playthrough is one verse in the infinite storybook of Anansi.
```
#### 3. 12 Loop Length & Cadence Targets

```
Loop Type Average Time Ideal Return Window Key Emotion
Micro Realm Stage) 5 10 min Same session Tension
Core Session Loop) 20 30 min Daily Engagement
Macro Realm Completion) 2 4 h Weekly Fulfillment
Legacy Cycle 7 Realms) 15 25 h Multi-week Reflection
```
#### 3. 13 Meta-Progression Logic

```
Progression follows two intertwined paths:
 Mechanical Progression  Unlocking Sanctum wings, new rituals, crafting
recipes, and tactical planning tools.
 Emotional Progression  Building trust, resolving hero trauma, confronting
Anansiʼs manipulation.
These paths reinforce each other: emotional harmony accelerates resource
generation and unlocks special Anansi dialogues; mechanical upgrades give
players new moral dilemmas.
```
#### 3. 14 Design Principle Summary

```
Every loop should produce one meaningful emotional change — a hero
evolves, a belief falters, or a truth emerges.
Failure must always teach; success must always cost something.
The world should feel alive even when the player steps away (idle Ase
generation, off-screen hero events).
Storytelling and system design are inseparable — every mechanic
contributes to Anansiʼs tapestry.

```
## Section 4 : Core Mechanics (v 2 – “Systems of

## Choice and Consequenceˮ)

#### 4. 1 Purpose

```
The Core Mechanics define the systems that transform Echoes of the
Sankofaʼs philosophy — empathy, autonomy, and legacy — into concrete,
playable structures.
These systems are not purely about combat, but about decisions,
relationships, and the emotional resonance of every encounter.
Each system has two layers:
 MVP Implementation: Minimal viable simulation for early testing and text-
based play.
 Full Implementation: Expanded mechanics, visual fidelity, and AI autonomy.
```
#### 4. 2 System Overview

```
#### 4. 3 Realm Stage System — “The Threads of Challengeˮ

```
Each Realm contains 5 6 stages , and each stage may hold one or several
types of encounters — not all are combat-focused.
The system ensures variety and pacing through Objective Templates ,
Encounter Types , and Hero Reactions.
```
#### Objective Templates

stance).
Each Realm stage can have multiple encounters , ensuring each mission feels
like a story chapter rather than a single battle.
```
#### 4. 4 Combat System — “The Dance of Aseˮ

#### Philosophy

```
Combat expresses emotional and moral struggle, not just physical power.
It is the most direct manifestation of the heroesʼ inner states — a stage where
courage, fear, and leadership collide.
```
#### Combat Flow

```
 Setup Phase: Player assigns heroes, reads morale and bond summaries.
 Blessing Phase: Keeper applies rituals or morale boosts.
 Action Phase: Step-based simulation (initiative order → action selection).
 Resolution Phase: Morale, health, and emotional shifts recorded.
 Aftermath Phase: AI dialogue summarizing reactions and trust changes.
```
Core Mechanics 3


```
Each battle log reads like a story — “Ama defied orders to protect the child; her
Courage grows, but Ambition stirs.ˮ
```
#### Encounters per Stage

```
MVP 1 2 encounters per stage, deterministic order.
Full: Up to 46 encounters per stage, some skippable through diplomacy or
exploration.
Some encounters can trigger AI disputes — heroes debate whether to
engage or withdraw.
```
#### 4. 5 Non-Combat Systems — “The Stories Between Battlesˮ

```
Non-combat challenges are equally vital. They reinforce mentorship, faith, and
story-driven agency.
System Description Example Outcome Drivers
Exploration &
Lore Discovery
```
```
Heroes investigate
ruins, recover
memories.
```
```
“The ruins whisper;
only the faithful may
listen.ˮ
```
```
Faith, Wisdom,
Virtue
Diplomacy /
Moral Choices
```
```
Heroes negotiate or
decide between moral
paths.
```
```
“Save the stranger or
follow orders.ˮ Virtue, Ambition
Ritual & Healing
Encounters
```
```
Heroes conduct
spiritual rites to
stabilize Ase.
```
```
“The ritual falters —
who leads the chant?ˮ Faith, Courage
```
```
AI Conversation
Events
```
```
Dialogue-driven
interludes between
stages.
```
```
“Esi questions your
decisions.ˮ
```
```
Keeper Trust,
Bond Strength
In the MVP, these appear as simple text nodes with outcome rolls ; later they
become AI-driven dynamic dialogues that evolve per heroʼs belief.
```
#### 4. 6 Morale & Fear System

```
Morale is an emotional currency of belief and connection. Fear is its erosion —
doubt, guilt, or despair.
```
Core Mechanics 4


```
Value Range State Effects
80  100 Inspired dialogue.10% effectiveness; triggers “Faith linesˮ in
50  79 Balanced Normal behavior.
30  49 Shaken 10% accuracy, higher Fear gain.
0  29 Broken May refuse combat, argue, or flee.
```
#### Core Emotional Triggers

```
Ally death or injury.
Low Sanctum morale.
Facing corrupted Abosom Fear spike).
Odo Agyanka whispers.
Keeper interventions (can restore or destabilize).
```
#### MVP Version

```
Numerical morale tracked per hero  0  100 . Text output only.
```
#### Full Version

```
Dynamic emotional state map (multi-variable graph).
Hero behavior, dialogue, and AI logic fully influenced by emotional fluctuations.
```
#### 4. 7 Hero Autonomy & Keeper Interaction

```
From the very first stages, heroes are semi-independent beings, learning to
interpret the Keeperʼs guidance.
```
#### Behavioral Range

```
Refuse Orders: May reject risky instructions or question morality of choice.
Argue: Challenge Keeperʼs philosophy or another heroʼs action.
Advise: Suggest alternative plans before missions.
Compliment / Encourage: Praise leadership or express loyalty.
```
#### Early Game (MVP)

Core Mechanics 5


```
Simple logic triggers: bravery checks, moral dilemmas, emotional state  70
= positive reaction.
Short text outputs (“Keeper, I feel this path is wrong.ˮ).
Training system not yet available; heroes remain reactive.
```
#### Mid–Late Game (Full)

```
The Keeper unlocks systems Shrine of Voices, Training Grounds) that
teach Echoes how to interpret guidance better.
Dialogue becomes relational — trust level modifies reaction tone.
Persistent AI memory: heroes remember past conflicts and acknowledge
growth.
```
#### 4. 8 AI Personality Logic — “Echo Behavior Matrixˮ

```
Each Echoʼs decisions are weighted by six traits + emotional modifiers.
Example (simplified MVP pseudocode):
if morale  40 and courage  5 
action = "hesitate"
elif virtue  7 and ally_injured:
action = "protect_ally"
elif ambition  8 and morale  50 
action = "disobey"
else:
action = "act_normally"
In full implementation:
Memory and dialogue logs expand this logic into living personalities.
The AI runs narrative conditionals (e.g., “Was betrayed before?ˮ →
response flavor).
AI continuously learns from player consistency (reputation system).
```
#### 4. 9 Procedural Generation & Determinism

```
All systems are seed-based — ensuring fairness and replayability.
```
Core Mechanics 6


```
A playerʼs journey is unique yet reproducible for balance testing.
```
#### Seed Formula

```
seed = hash(player_seed + realm_index + stage_index  Anansi_modifier)
This defines:
Stage objectives and enemies.
Moral encounters and loot tables.
Narrative tone adjustments based on Anansi Events.
```
#### Anansi Modifier

```
An invisible variable that subtly alters outcomes over time, symbolizing the
tricksterʼs influence.
In later builds, this evolves into full AI narrative branching — each replay
becomes a unique version of the myth.
```
#### 4. 10 Legacy & Consequence

```
When heroes die, their spirit becomes a Legacy Fragment , carrying traits,
memories, and emotional imprints.
MVP
Single stat inheritance (best trait).
Simple text log summarizing loss.
Forge of Souls allows manual combination.
Full:
Narrative inheritance system — fragments influence future Echo personality
and voice.
Emotional memory transmission (“I remember the one who failed before
me.ˮ).
Mutations possible through Anansi interference (e.g., “Mark of Tricksterˮ).
Every consequence, from dialogue to death, becomes part of the evolving
lineage tapestry.

## Section 5 : Heroes / Units / Characters

## (v 2 — “Echoes of Personalityˮ)

## 5 A. Hero Design — “The Echoes of Aseˮ

#### 5 A. 1 Purpose

```
Heroes — called Echoes — are the emotional and mechanical heart of Echoes
of the Sankofa.
They are not soldiers or expendable units, but fragments of memory reborn
through the Ase Flame , carrying fragments of the worldʼs forgotten stories.
The player does not control them directly — instead, the player guides,
mentors, and interprets their actions.
Echoes are autonomous, emotional agents whose behaviors, growth, and even
loyalty depend on how well they understand — and are understood by — the
Keeper.
```
Heroes / Units / Characters 1


#### 5 A. 2 Hero Lifecycle Overview

```
Each Echo lives through five distinct stages of existence:
 Summoning: The Echo emerges from the Ase Flame with initial traits and a
blurred identity.
 Guidance & Growth: The Keeper mentors and trains them in the Sanctum,
shaping class and morality.
 Realms of Ase: The Echo joins a squad, facing fear, doubt, and corruption
through multi-encounter missions.
 Ascendance or Death: The Echo either matures emotionally or falls
permanently. Their spirit releases a Legacy Fragment.
 Inheritance: Future generations merge these fragments, continuing the
cycle of remembrance.
Every hero is a chapter in the Keeperʼs larger story — no two are ever the
same.
```
#### 5 A. 3 Ranks & Growth

```
Ranks express not only strength but spiritual awareness — how “awakeˮ an
Echo is to their purpose.

Echoes develop emotional intelligence.
MVP No persistence; emotions reset per mission.
Full: Persistent moral memory — heroes recall past dilemmas, forming
ideological stances.
The Keeperʼs leadership philosophy propagates across generations, shaping
future summonsʼ base personalities.
```
#### 5 B. 8 Voice of the Lineage

```
In advanced builds, the Hall of Lineage allows the Keeper to commune with
ancestral fragments — past heroes commenting on current events or guiding
decisions.
“The next flame burns brighter... may it not blind itself.ˮ
“The trickster watches still, but he cannot weave our will.ˮ
These ancestral “echoes of voicesˮ make the world feel alive and cyclic —
every generation aware of the myth they are part of.

## Section 6 : World / Realm Structure (v 3 –

## Final Canon Version)

## 6 A. Realm System & Symbolism — “Threads of the

## Worldˮ

#### 6 A. 1 Purpose

```
This section defines the architectural, procedural, and emotional design of
the Realms of Ase — the living worlds of Echoes of the Sankofa.
Each Realm embodies a fallen virtue and a fragment of Anansiʼs divine game
between remembrance and oblivion.
Realms are not static levels; they are mythic parables — reflections of the
playerʼs moral state and the emotional evolution of their heroes.
```
#### 6 A. 2 Realm System Overview

World / Realm Structure 1


```
Each Realm represents a fallen virtue twisted by corruption and restored
through leadership, empathy, and sacrifice.
Restoring a Realm revives that Virtue, unlocking new mechanics and
Sanctum features.
Each Realm is built from 5 6 stages , each with its own encounters and
events.
Stage types include both combat and non-combat missions.
Emotional difficulty rises with each Realm — not only in power, but in moral
complexity.
```
#### 6 A. 3 Realm Progression Flow

```

Mid-game and beyond, the Keeper may manage multiple Realms
simultaneously , balancing:
Hero assignments
Sanctum morale
Ase expenditure
Anansiʼs random interventions
```
#### 6 A. 4 Realm Generation — Procedural Architecture

```
Procedural seed generation ensures replayability and fairness.
Each Realmʼs conditions, encounters, and modifiers are determined by a
deterministic seed , influenced by the Keeperʼs empathy, the realmʼs virtue, and
Anansiʼs interference.
Formula Example:
```
World / Realm Structure 2


```
RealmSeed = PlayerID  RealmIndex  KeeperEmpathy  AnansiModifier)

## Heart of Continuityˮ

#### 7 A. 1 Purpose

```
The Obosom Sanctum is the Keeperʼs domain — part stronghold, part soul, and
part reflection of their leadership.
It serves as both a strategic hub for gameplay and an emotional barometer for
the story world.
```
Base / Hub / Management Systems 1


```
Mechanically, the Sanctum is where the player:
Manages resources Ase, Ekwan, Relics).
Nurtures heroes and recovers morale.
Unlocks upgrades and new systems.
Prepares for Realm expeditions.
Narratively, it is a living space — it grows, brightens, or decays with every
choice.
Every sound, shadow, and voice in the Sanctum mirrors the Keeperʼs current
state of faith and harmony.
```
#### 7 A. 2 Structural Overview

```
The Sanctum is divided into Wings , each with:
A Core Function (mechanical purpose).
A Virtue Association (philosophical tie).
A Physical Manifestation (style and ambience).
A Hero Staff Role AI personnel).
An Upgrade Path (progression cost and effect).
Players gradually rebuild the Sanctum as they restore Realms and guide their
heroes toward emotional stability.

7 A Summary  The Structural Core
The Sanctum is a modular, upgradeable hub that grows in both complexity and
emotion.
It turns abstract moral choices into tangible worldbuilding: every light, wall, and
sound tells the story of how the Keeper leads.
```
### 7 B. Emotional & Narrative Identity — “The Soul of

### the Sanctumˮ

#### 7 B. 1 Purpose

```
This section defines the emotional, social, and narrative systems that make
the Sanctum feel alive.
Itʼs not a static interface — itʼs a breathing society bound by belief, conflict, and
memory.
Heroes live here.
Anansi watches here.
And the Keeperʼs soul quietly shapes it all.
```
#### 7 B. 2 Design Philosophy — “The Soul Made Visibleˮ

```
The Sanctum represents the Keeperʼs inner world externalized.
Its beauty or decay mirrors:
The Faith of heroes,
```
Base / Hub / Management Systems 6


```
The Harmony of relationships, and
The Favor of Anansi.
It is both mirror and map — showing who the Keeper has become.
“Every stone, every voice, every silence remembers you.ˮ

variables:

#### 7 B. 4 Hero Behavior & AI Society

```
Heroes inhabit the Sanctum as autonomous agents.
```
Base / Hub / Management Systems 7


```
They rest, reflect, train, argue, and engage each other — forming an AI-driven
micro-society.
State Behavior Example Text
Resting Reflects near Ase Flame. “The flame hums with theirmemories.ˮ
Conversing Debates moral events. “Was mercy worth the cost?ˮ
Training Practices skills or sparring. “Every failure tempers my soul.ˮ
Arguing Rivphilosophal clashes oy. ver “The Keeper plays god, not guide.ˮ
Meditating Quiet prayer to the Flame. “Silence is its own courage.ˮ
Heroes remember emotional outcomes, referencing previous missions or
dialogues across sessions.
```
#### 7 B. 5 Relationship Ecology

```
Relationships define the Sanctumʼs social equilibrium.
Type Behavior Effect
Bond Deep trust; mutual morale boost. Harmony, faster recovery.
Rivalry Tension, eventual growth. Harmony until resolved.
Mentorship Senior hero mentors another. XP, Faith.
Isolation Withdrawn, skeptical hero. Faith, risk of despair events.
Emotional Contagion: One heroʼs despair can lower Harmony Sanctum-wide,
forcing the player to intervene socially or spiritually.
```
#### 7 B. 6 The Keeperʼs Presence

```
The Keeper never speaks aloud, yet their influence shapes every conversation.
Player Action Hero Reaction Outcome

```
#### 7 B. 7 Anansiʼs Influence

```
Anansiʼs threads are woven through every wall of the Sanctum.
He interferes at moments of tension, delighting in chaos and moral paradox.
Interference Type Example Effect

Trickster Event “flame.A voice laughs thrˮ ough the Tfallout.emporary buff or emotional

#### 8 A. 1 Purpose

```
The economy of Echoes of the Sankofa is a moral and spiritual ecosystem.
It represents the flow of divine energy (Ase) and emotion between the Realms,
the heroes, and the Sanctum.
It sustains both gameplay progression and narrative meaning — resources
arenʼt just currencies, but manifestations of moral choices.
To hoard or waste them is to misunderstand the balance of creation.
“Energy must move, faith must circulate, and nothing — not even memory —
should remain still.ˮ

```
OpenAI GPT4o — strong text/code + fast multimodal; good for in-game
barks, summaries, and tool-use RAG. Official docs: model page & launch
overview.
Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet — excellent reasoning, safe long-context;
great for moral event drafting & debriefs. Official announcement/model
card. Also available on Bedrock for enterprise.
Meta Llama 3. 1 405B/70B/8B — open weights (self-hosted or managed),
good for on-prem /edge builds where privacy or cost control matters.
Mistral Premier / Medium 3 — strong, efficient, supports private/VPC
deployment; good latency/cost tradeoffs for live games.
Cohere Command R / R — enterprise-friendly, long-context, retrieval-
heavy workflows (design docs, in-game codex).
Inworld AI — specialized NPC platform for games (voice, memory, safety).
Useful to accelerate character authoring and runtime persona without

```
Latency  Cap LLM calls per round (e.g., 12 total, not per hero). Use
template barks for most events; reserve LLM for special moments.
Cost  Batch debriefs; compress prompts with structured JSON
(“emotion=Shaken; event=RefuseEscortˮ).
Safety  Use provider moderation and instruction-rails; Anthropic
“constitutionalˮ safety and OpenAI policies cover most needs.

```
#### 10. 3. 2 Trauma (Emotional) – Core

```
Triggered by: ally death, moral failures, terrifying bosses, Anansi events.
Effects: Morale cap reduction, Fear gain rate ↑, refusal chance ↑, dialogue
tone shifts.
Recovery via Shrine of Voices (therapy), Meditation Garden , bond
sessions , or pilgrimage missions.
```
#### 10. 3. 3 Corruption (Spiritual) – Advanced

```

Permadeath is canon. A dead Echo is not fieldable again.
On death: generate a Legacy Fragment (see 10. 6 , update Hall of Lineage ,
trigger Sanctum Grief Event Faith/Harmony shifts), and log Last Words AI

Exceptional Paths (rare / late-game):
Ancestor Ascension: In rare story cases, a fallen Echo may become a

### 10. 12 Design Ethics & Player Emotion

```
The system honors loss without exploitation: no gacha resurrection loops.
Recovery prioritizes care over grind: time, attention, and ritual matter.
Legacy makes death constructive : stories are not erased; they become
scaffolding for future courage.
Section 10 Complete  Legacy, Death & Recovery
Mortality gains purpose, recovery gains meaning, and legacy becomes the
bridge between generations—mechanically sound in MVP and poetically deep
in Full.

## Section 11 : Crafting & Research Systems

## (v 1 – Final Canon Version)

## 11. 1 Purpose

```
Crafting & Research turn Realm discoveries into lasting capability. They are the
long-horizon systems that transform Ase, Ekwan, and Relics into rituals, gear,
upgrades, and insight —with risk. Outcomes affect not only stats but Faith,
Harmony, and the emotional texture of the Sanctum.
Crafting happens primarily at the Forge of Souls , Divinerʼs Library , and
Marketplace of Spirits.
Research is driven by the Divinerʼs Library (knowledge tree) and Hall of
Lineage (heritage unlocks).
Risk (burnout, faith crisis, corruption) keeps choices meaningful.
MVP focuses on a slim set of recipes, linear research, and deterministic
outcomes.
```

### 11. 2 Systems Overview

```
Player Loop (between expeditions):
Choose project → assign heroes (optional) → pay cost → wait time → resolve →
equip/apply → new options unlock.
Key Resources: Ase (power), Ekwan (materials), Relics (rare catalysts),
Faith/Harmony/Favor (emotional modifiers).

## Section 12 : Balance Curves & Simulation

## Data (v 1 – Final Canon Version)

## 12. 1 Purpose

```
To establish clear mathematical relationships and progression curves that:
Keep resource generation and consumption balanced across play sessions.
Maintain emotional pacing Faith, Morale, Fear, Harmony).
Ensure predictable growth for heroes and Sanctum expansion without
grind.
Provide formulas for automated simulation tools to test economy and
morale loops.
```
Balance Curves & Simulation Data 1


```
These curves are the heartbeat beneath narrative consequence , allowing for
emotional highs and lows to align with gameplay flow.
```
### 12. 2 Core Balancing Principles

```
 Faith & Ase Equilibrium  Faith must always influence Ase yield; high Faith
= comfort loop, low Faith = stress loop.
 Ekwan Scarcity  Physical material limits drive strategic choice, not time
gates.
 Emotional Decay over Inflation  Fear and Morale fluctuate cyclically, not
linearly.
 Soft Caps, No Hard Walls  Encourage experimentation through diminishing
returns.
 Rhythmic Growth  Every 34 Realms feels like a full “actˮ with difficulty
and resource inflection.

Guiding principles
 Determinism by Default: All tactical outcomes reproduce from a seed; LLM
output is cosmetic and never changes resolved gameplay.
 Schema First: Versioned JSON schemas for portability + migration.
 Modules, Not Monoliths: Heroes, Realms, Sanctum, and Economy are
separate data domains with explicit contracts.

### 13. 4 Determinism & PRNG Seeding Model

```
Goal: Given a save + seeds, combat & encounters replay 1 1.
Seed hierarchy
campaign_seed (top-level, user-agnostic; generated once per cycle)
realm_seed[realm_id]  H(campaign_seed + realm_id)
stage_seed  H(realm_seed + stage_index)
encounter_seed  H(stage_seed + encounter_index)
combat_seed  H(encounter_seed + "combat:"+timestamp_floor)
loot_seed  H(encounter_seed + "loot")
H is a fast, deterministic hash (e.g., xxHash64/CityHash) producing a 64-bit
integer for the PRNG.
PRNG
Use a stable, fast PRNG (e.g., Xoroshiro 128 or PCG32 ).
Store current PRNG state per subsystem (combat, loot) in the save to
resume mid-encounter.
LLM Isolation
LLM outputs (barks) do not touch sim outcomes. If needed for replay,
cache the rendered text with a short seed to reproduce style , not state.
Pseudocode
def derive(seed:str, salt:str)→int:
return xxhash64((seed + "|" + salt).encode()).intdigest()
```

### 13. 6 Content Data: Assets vs. State

```
Assets (readonly) : shipped JSON (recipes, relic templates, realm
definitions, abilities).
Namespaced keys: "realm.vale_of_dust", "recipe.ward_beads_t1".
Version each content pack: "content_version": "pack- 2025 .10".
State (mutable) : player save (values, timers, seeds).
Lookup : state references asset IDs; game never copies asset bodies into
save.
```
### 13. 7 Validation & Contracts

```
Hard validation on load
Required fields exist; enums valid; timers sane; numeric ranges (e.g., 0 
Faith  100 .
If invalid → safe rollback to previous save + error banner.
Soft validation
Warn on potential inconsistencies (e.g., hero in two queues).
Auto-repair routines (remove dupes, clamp stats).
Contracts
Combat reads hero snapshots; writes back only deltas (hp, morale, fear,
conditions), plus an encounter log.
Sanctum owns timers; Economy owns resource mutations;
Research/Crafting owns queues; Legacy writes fragments.
```
### 13. 8 Telemetry & Replay

```
Ring buffer of recent events (cap 25k entries).
Minimal payload per event:
```

Replay header : campaign_seed, realm_order, build_id.
Anonymization : no real user data.
```
### 13. 9 Migrations

```
SemVer : bump minor for additive fields, major for breaking changes.
Migration scripts JSON transform):
12.x  13 .0 example: move morale from hero root into stats.
Compatibility policy : support latest  2 minor versions; auto-backup
originals.

## Telemetry (v 1 – Final Canon Version)

## 15. 1 Purpose

```
To guarantee that every system—mechanical, emotional, and narrative—
communicates clearly, consistently, and compassionately with the player.
This section defines:
User Interface principles and modular layout rules.
Accessibility standards for readability and inclusivity.
Feedback loops connecting player action to visible consequence.
Telemetry metrics used to validate design goals, detect pain points, and
tune emotional pacing.
“If the world speaks in riddles, the interface must translate them into truth.ˮ
```

### 15. 2 Design Philosophy

```
 Clarity Over Complexity: Every UI element must show state and
consequence at a glance.
 Emotion as Data: Faith, Morale, and Harmony are UI elements—display
them like health bars of the soul.
 Accessible First: Text legibility, contrast, color independence, and reading
rhythm guide visual design.
 Player as Observer, Not Operator: The Keeper doesnʼt press buttons; they
witness and influence.
 Transparency of Cause & Effect: Always tell the player why something
happened (refusal, decay, loss).
